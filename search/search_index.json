Target Audience: Developers and AI Agents (Gemini). Prerequisites Autodesk Flame must be running. The Flame Listener must be deployed and active in the current project. Check: You should see Flame listener listening on 127.0.0.1:5555 in the Flame shell/logs. Deploy: If not running, use python scripts/deploy_to_flame_project.py --copy --scripts-dir <PATH_TO_PROJECT_PYTHON_SETUPS> and restart Flame. Step-by-Step Guide 1. Run the Collector Script Open a terminal in the repository root and run: python scripts/collect_flame_api.py --include-all --include-all : Forces the script to inspect every discovered symbol (classes, functions, singletons) instead of just the core Py* classes. 2. Locate the Output The script creates a timestamped directory for each run: reports/api_dump/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/ Inside you will find: * index.json : A summary of all crawled items. * <SymbolName>.json : Detailed introspection for each object (e.g., PyBatch.json , execute_command.json ). 3. Generate Type Stubs (Optional but Recommended) To update the IDE autocompletion and type checking files, run: python scripts/generate_stubs_from_reports.py --latest This will update stubs/flame.pyi with the signatures and docstrings extracted from the latest crawl. 4. Compare Versions (Optional) To see what changed between Flame versions (e.g., pr235 vs pr236 ): 1. Run the collector on the old version. 2. Run the collector on the new version. 3. Compare the two timestamped directories using diff or a visual diff tool. Instructions for AI Agents (Gemini) If you are an AI assistant tasked with updating the API definitions or checking for version compatibility, follow this protocol: Verify Connection: Run python scripts/verify_listener.py to confirm the bridge is active. Execute Crawl: Run python scripts/collect_flame_api.py --include-all . Ingest Results: Read the generated reports/api_dump/<latest_timestamp>/index.json to understand the scope. Read specific <Symbol>.json files to update your internal knowledge or generate type stubs ( .pyi ). Troubleshooting Connection Refused: The listener is not running in Flame. Check flame.project.json or your deployment paths. Timeout: The API might be busy. The script waits 10s per request. Ensure Flame is not blocked by a modal dialog.","title":"How to Generate Flame API Reports"},{"location":"HOWTO_GENERATE_API_REPORTS/#how-to-generate-flame-api-reports","text":"This guide explains how to systematically crawl the running Autodesk Flame Python API to generate detailed JSON reports of all available modules, classes, functions, and properties.

Run in Extension Development Host (fast) Open this repository in VS Code. Open the extension/ folder in the Explorer. Press F5 (Run \u2192 Start Debugging) to launch the Extension Development Host. In the host window, open the Command Palette and run: Flame: Connect to connect to a listener (or use the mock server in tests/ ), Flame: Start debug server to request Flame start a debug server, Flame: Run in Flame to send the current file/selection to Flame. Development virtual environment We recommend using a system Python virtual environment for running tests and development tools so your environment is stable across Flame preview upgrades. Quick setup: # Create a system venv in repo root using system python3 python3 -m venv .venv # Activate source .venv/bin/activate # Install dev deps python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel python -m pip install -r requirements.txt Or run the helper script: scripts/setup_dev_env.sh [python3] VS Code: select the interpreter from the Command Palette or rely on the workspace setting python.defaultInterpreterPath which points to ${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python . If you want me to create the .venv now I can (I'll use system python3 unless you prefer otherwise). Flame package dependencies & notes The repository includes a set of runtime packages commonly used with Flame which we install into the dev venv for testing: PySide6 , OpenImageIO , OpenTimelineIO , OpenColorIO . Import names can differ from the pip package names (for example, opentimelineio is the import for OpenTimelineIO). In our smoke test OpenColorIO was not importable under OpenColorIO or opencolorio but is available as the PyOpenColorIO package (import as PyOpenColorIO ). The PyPI package name is opencolorio and docs are at https://opencolorio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start/installation.html. Prefer Flame-provided libraries when available. These packages include native/binary wheels that are tied to the Python ABI and macOS platform. If you upgrade Python (or change OS/architecture) you may need to reinstall or rebuild wheels. Verify imports in your dev venv with the included helper: source .venv/bin/activate python scripts/smoke_imports.py Environment variables - FLAME_LISTENER_LOG \u2014 path to append structured listener logs (defaults to /tmp/flame_listener.log ). - FLAME_LISTENER_RECV_TIMEOUT \u2014 socket recv timeout in seconds for each client connection (defaults to 5.0 ). Collecting debug info - Use scripts/collect_flame_debug_logs.py to collect a small bundle (ps, lsof, listener ping, a short breakpoint test, and head/tail of listener log) into /tmp for easier triage. To verify behavior inside a running Flame instance, use Flame: Run in Flame to execute a short script that prints import/version info, or run a small end-to-end test against the real Flame runtime. Example script: examples/inspect_flame_env.py prints the detected import names and versions for the common Flame runtime packages. Run it locally in your dev venv ( python examples/inspect_flame_env.py ) or send it to Flame with Flame: Run in Flame . Automated smoke test: tests/test_imports.py will attempt the same imports and will skip if packages are not available in the environment (so CI can opt-in by installing the binary deps). - When Flame's Python ABI or installation changes, recreate your venv ( rm -rf .venv && python3 -m venv .venv && scripts/setup_dev_env.sh ) before running dependent tests.

Below is the clean, architecture\u2011level breakdown of what\u2019s required. \ud83e\udde9 1. A host\u2011side listener running inside Flame Flame must run a small Python process that: Listens on a TCP socket, Unix socket, or named pipe Receives Python code sent from VS Code Executes it inside Flame\u2019s embedded Python interpreter Returns stdout/stderr or structured JSON back to VS Code This is the same pattern used by: - Maya\u2019s commandPort - Nuke\u2019s TCP Python bridge - Houdini\u2019s hrpyc - Blender\u2019s remote Python server What this listener must handle Authentication (simple token or local\u2011only binding) Execution sandboxing (Flame API calls must run on the main thread) Error capture and return Optional: auto\u2011reload of modules for iterative development How you\u2019d run it Flame allows Python hooks and background tasks.

A VS Code extension that talks to the listener This is the \u201cAdobe Script Runner\u201d equivalent. The extension would: Provide a command: Run in Flame Send the current file or selected text to the Flame listener Display results in a VS Code output panel Optionally provide: Autocomplete stubs for the Flame API Snippets for PyClip, PySequence, PySegment, etc. A \u201cconnect/disconnect\u201d status indicator Implementation stack Node.js extension using net.Socket or WebSocket Configuration for host/port Commands bound to keyboard shortcuts \ud83e\udde9 3. Flame Python API stubs for IntelliSense VS Code can\u2019t introspect Flame\u2019s Python environment directly, so you\u2019d generate stub files: flame.pyi PyClip.pyi PySequence.pyi PySegment.pyi PyTime.pyi etc. These stubs would provide: Autocomplete Type hints Docstrings Method signatures You can generate them by: - Scraping the Autodesk docs - Using dir() inside Flame and exporting attributes - Manually writing .pyi files This is exactly how Blender, Houdini, and Nuke provide IntelliSense in VS Code. \ud83e\udde9 4.

This is a practical blueprint , not a hand\u2011wave. If you wanted to build this, this is exactly what you\u2019d implement. 1. Flame\u2011Side Component: The Python Listener This is the missing piece Flame doesn\u2019t provide natively. You embed a small Python server inside Flame\u2019s Python interpreter that: Opens a local TCP socket (e.g., localhost:5555 ) Accepts incoming Python code Executes it inside Flame\u2019s environment Returns stdout, stderr, and exceptions Ensures Flame API calls run on the main thread Core responsibilities Execution loop Receive \u2192 Execute \u2192 Return result Thread safety Flame API calls must run on the UI thread; you wrap execution in flame.execute_on_main_thread() . Security Bind to localhost only, require a token, or use a Unix domain socket. Lifecycle Start automatically via a Flame Python hook. Where it lives Flame loads Python from: /opt/Autodesk/flame_2025/python/ ~/.config/Autodesk/Flame/python/ You\u2019d install the listener as a Flame startup hook: python/startup/flame_listener.py 2. Communication Protocol Keep it simple and robust. Transport TCP socket (easiest) Optional: WebSocket (if you want browser\u2011based tools later) Optional: Unix domain socket (secure, local\u2011only) Message format Use JSON for structured communication: { \"command\": \"execute\", \"code\": \"import flame\\nprint(flame.project.current_project.name)\" } Response format { \"stdout\": \"MyProject\\n\", \"stderr\": \"\", \"exception\": null } 3. VS Code Extension This is the user\u2011facing part \u2014 the equivalent of Adobe Script Runner. Capabilities Run in Flame command Sends selected text or entire file to the Flame listener. Output panel Displays stdout, stderr, exceptions. Connection manager Connect/disconnect, show status, auto\u2011reconnect. Keyboard shortcuts e.g., Ctrl+Shift+F to execute in Flame. Snippets Quickly insert common Flame API patterns. Optional: Debugger integration If you embed debugpy inside Flame. Extension structure flame-vscode/ package.json extension.js src/ client.js commands/ runInFlame.js connect.js disconnect.js syntaxes/ snippets/ stubs/ User workflow Open a .py file. Press \u201cRun in Flame\u201d. Code executes inside Flame instantly. Output appears in VS Code. 4. Flame API IntelliSense (Stub Files) VS Code cannot introspect Flame\u2019s embedded Python, so you generate .pyi stub files. Stub generation approach Inside Flame: import flame dir(flame) You then generate: stubs/flame.pyi stubs/PyClip.pyi stubs/PySequence.pyi stubs/PySegment.pyi ... These provide: Autocomplete Type hints Docstrings Method signatures Integration The VS Code extension ships with these stubs and configures: \"python.analysis.extraPaths\": [ \"./stubs\" ] 5. Optional: Debugger Integration This is advanced but possible. Approach Bundle debugpy with the Flame listener. Start a debug server inside Flame. VS Code attaches to it. Limitations Flame\u2019s Python interpreter is embedded and single\u2011threaded. Breakpoints inside Flame API calls may freeze the UI. Still, it\u2019s doable for non\u2011UI\u2011blocking code. 6. Optional: File Sync & Auto\u2011Reload To mimic Blender/Maya add\u2011on workflows: Features Auto\u2011sync your VS Code project into Flame\u2019s Python directory. Auto\u2011reload modules when files change. One\u2011click packaging for Flame Python hooks. Implementation Use VS Code\u2019s file watcher API to push changes to Flame via: SFTP rsync Local mount Or the socket protocol itself 7. Optional: Batch/Action Node Helpers You can extend the extension to: Create Batch nodes from VS Code Modify Action setups Inspect clip metadata Trigger renders Query project structure This is where the Flame API becomes extremely powerful. 8.
